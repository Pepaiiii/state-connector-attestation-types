# 00002 - Balance Decreasing Transaction

- id: 2
- name: `BalanceDecreasingTransaction`
- [Definition file](https://github.com/flare-foundation/attestation-client/blob/main/lib/verification/attestation-types/t-00002-balance-decreasing-transaction.ts)

## Description

The purpose of this attestation type is to prove that a transaction was issued from a given account (address), which could possibly facilitate a decrease of funds on the account (the source address). In some DeFi protocols or applications, monitoring the balance of specific accounts is of the utmost importance (e.g. accounts that hold collateral). This includes detecting transactions that are outside the application specific protocol workflows. Using the balance decreasing proof, one (e.g. challenger) can signal to a DeFi protocol that some transaction has occurred. Then the protocol can verify, whether the transaction is legitimate or it constitutes an illegal action. Based on that, the smart contracts running the protocol can sanction the offender and possibly reward the provider of the proof.

Any transaction can be seen as a balance decreasing transaction, if funds could have left the source address (e.g. due to fees). So even if no funds are sent out, or even if the balance is actually increased, as long as the address is used as an input, this is considered as a balance decreasing transaction for a source address (such cases can happen with UTXO transactions).

For this attestation type we assume that the source address being tested is not a contract account, but something called Externally Owned Account (EOA, in Ethereum terminology). Basically that means that this is an address from which funds can be removed only if the owner of the private key for the address signs the payment transaction.

If the account is a contract account, removal of funds from the contract address could be carried out in different ways, using the contract calls (like claiming), self-destruct mechanism, etc. Using the self-destruct mechanism, even an address that could be a contract address but nothing is yet deployed on it, can be abused.
Hence, prior to using the proof in a DeFi protocol, the particular application using the proof should verify, that the account being checked is an EOA. Verifying whether a certain source address is an EOA depends on the chain being used. In non-smart contract chains (like BTC, LTC, DOGE, XRP, ...) all addresses are EOAs.

A successful attestation is provided by extracting certain data about the transaction, which includes:

- Block number
- Block timestamp
- Transaction hash
- Source address
- Input UTXO, indicating the source address of interest
- Spent amount
- [Payment reference](https://github.com/flare-foundation/multi-chain-client/blob/main/docs/definitions/payment-reference.md)

Due to technical limitations on UTXO chains, the procedure for the attestation differs according to the existence of a standardized payment reference. In essence, payments with a standardized payment references undergo [full attestation](https://github.com/flare-foundation/multi-chain-client/blob/main/docs/definitions/account-based-vs-utxo-chains.md) whereas other payments undergo partial attestation. In non-UTXO chains full attestation is always performed.

## Request format

Beside the standard fields (`attestationType`, `sourceId` and `upperBoundProof`) the request for a `BalanceDecreasingTransaction` attestation type contains in addition fields `id` and `inUtxo`.

| Name                   | Size (bytes) | Internal type      | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `attestationType`      | 2            | `AttestationType`  | Attestation type id for this request, see `AttestationType` enum.            |
| `sourceId`             | 4            | `SourceId`         | The ID of the underlying chain, see `SourceId` enum.                         |
| `messageIntegrityCode` | 32           | `ByteSequenceLike` | The hash of the expected attestation response appended by string 'Flare'. Used to verify consistency of the attestation response against the anticipated result, thus preventing wrong (forms of) attestations. |
| `id`                   | 32           | `ByteSequenceLike` | Transaction hash to search for.                                              |
| `inUtxo`               | 1            | `NumberLike`       | Index of the source address on UTXO chains. Always 0 for non-UTXO chains.     |

## Verification rules

### General

- Only transactions that are signed by the source address' account are considered - so called Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

### UTXO (BTC, LTC, DOGE) specific

- A valid (single address) must appear on `inUtxo`. Otherwise, the attestation is rejected.
- Payment reference is calculated only if the attested transaction confirms to ([standardized payment reference](https://github.com/flare-foundation/multi-chain-client/blob/main/docs/definitions/payment-reference.md)). Otherwise, the payment reference is 0.
- Full attestation is performed only if the standardized payment reference exists (see [here](https://github.com/flare-foundation/multi-chain-client/blob/main/docs/definitions/account-based-vs-utxo-chains.md) for details). Otherwise, partial attestation is performed. In particular that has an impact on how `spentAmount` is calculated.
- The value `inUtxo` in response for non-UTXO chains is always 0.

## Response format

| Name                   | Type         | Description                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blockNumber`          | `uint64`     | Number of the transaction block on the underlying chain.    |
| `blockTimestamp`       | `uint64`     | Timestamp of the transaction block on the underlying chain. |
| `transactionHash`      | `bytes32`    | Hash of the transaction on the underlying chain.            |
| `inUtxo`               | `uint8`      | Index of the transaction input indicating source address on UTXO chains, 0 on non-UTXO chains. |
| `sourceAddressHash`    | `bytes32`    | Hash of the source address viewed as a string (the one indicated by the `inUtxo` parameter for UTXO blockchains). |
| `spentAmount`          | `int256`     | The amount that went out of the source address, in the smallest underlying units. In non-UTXO chains it includes both payment value and fee (gas). Calculation for UTXO chains depends on the existence of standardized payment reference. If it exists, it is calculated as `outgoing_amount - returned_amount` and can be negative. If the standardized payment reference does not exist, then it is just the spent amount on the input indicated by `inUtxo`. |
| `paymentReference`     | `bytes32`    | Standardized payment reference, if it exists, 0 otherwise. |
