# 00004 - Referenced Payment Nonexistence

- id: 4
- name: `ReferencedPaymentNonexistence`  
- [Definition file](https://github.com/flare-foundation/attestation-client/blob/main/lib/verification/attestation-types/t-00004-referenced-payment-nonexistence.ts)

## Description

[Standardized payment references](https://github.com/flare-foundation/multi-chain-client/blob/main/docs/definitions/payment-reference.md) are used to indicate special transactions. Usual use case involves a DeFi protocol that uses the attestation protocol, which requires from its users to make certain payments until certain deadline. Standardized payment reference is used for matching the payments to the paying users and their purposes. The purpose of this attestation type is to provide a proof that a transaction (payment) with a specific standardized payment reference, sending a specific amount of the native currency to a specific address was not carried out up to certain deadline. Such an attestation can be used as proof of a breach of payment obligations a user may have in relation to a DeFi protocol.

In some cases it could happen that a user tried to fullfil the obligation, but the obligation could not be fulfilled, which was not due to its fault, but rather the fault of the receiver (e.g. input transactions are blocked). On some blockchains such transactions are recorded in blocks as failed transactions with special failure statuses, that indicate that the fault is on the receiving side and that the sender did all in its power to fullfil the obligation. See [here](https://github.com/flare-foundation/multi-chain-client/blob/main/docs/definitions/transaction-status.md) for discussion on transaction status.

The attestations of this type are confirmed if and only if any of the two cases happened:
- the required transaction was not made in due time or 
- it was made in due time, but it failed due to the sender's fault.

Note that if the sender tried to make the transaction in due time but the transaction failed and the failure was due to receiver, the verification fails. In other words, the verification fails if the sender was successful in sending the required transaction (a transaction may fail and get recorded to the blockchain and the failure can clearly be attributed to the receiver).


Deadline for a transaction to be attested for is usually provided by two limitations:
- `deadlineBlockNumber` - the last block number to be counted in as valid,
- `deadlineTimestamp` - the last block timestamp in seconds to be counted in as valid.

Given a transaction in block `blockNumber` with `blockTimestamp` a transaction for which one of the following is true meets the criteria of being executed in time:
- `blockNumber <= deadlineBlockNumber`, or
- `blockTimestamp <= deadlineTimestamp`.

An **overflow block** block is any block for which the block number and the timestamp are both strictly greater than `deadlineBlockNumber` and `deadlineTimestamp`. 

A [query window synchronization mechanism](../indexing/synchronized-query-window.md) uses the hash `upperBoundProof` of a confirmation block for a synchronizing the confirmed upper boundary block between attestation providers. For this attestation to be valid, the `upperBoundProof` must be provided in the request for such a confirmed block that is an overflow block. Otherwise the attestation is rejected.


Upon not being able to find the required transaction, a successful attestation is provided by extracting certain data from the indexer and request
- required deadline timestamp
- required deadline block number
- required destination address
- required amount
- required payment reference
- lower query boundary block number
- lower query boundary block timestamp
- first (lowest) overflow block number
- first (lowest) overflow block timestamp

In such a way the attestation confirms the required transaction did not appear in the interval between lower query boundary block (included) and the first overflow block (excluded).

## Verification rules

- The confirmed block that is confirmed by the confirmation block with the hash `upperBoundProof` must be an overflow block.
- Payment nonexistence is confirmed if there is no [native payment](https://github.com/flare-foundation/multi-chain-client/blob/main/docs/definitions/native-payment.md) transactions with [standardized payment reference](https://github.com/flare-foundation/multi-chain-client/blob/main/docs/definitions/payment-reference.md) that meets all criteria for Payment attestation type (00001 - Payment) and its transaction status is 0 - Success or 2 - Failure due to receiver. 
- If there exist only payment(s) with status 1 (failure, sender's fault) then payment nonexistence is still confirmed.

## Comments

A DeFi system should use the data of from the attestation (proof) according to its needs. Note that due to limited history and time dependant lower query bound (depends on state connector `roundId`) it may happen that `lowerBoundaryBlockNumber` is too high (attestation may be requested too late). Determination of the `lowerBoundaryBlockNumber` depends on Flare network timestamp which may differ from real time and as the block timestamps on other chains could vary even more. The time skew that between the other chain times must also be accounted for.
